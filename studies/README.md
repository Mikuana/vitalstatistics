# Overview
The purpose of this project is to use the tools of data science to better understand the way that deliveries in the United States (US) via cesarean section have changed over time. It is hoped that by better understanding these changes, patterns can be identified that will help to inform decision makers. The goal of this project is to provide objective, human-centric guidance (as opposed to machine learning algorithms) that can be used to inform policy at either the facility or system levels of health care, and ultimately reduce the rate of cesarean section in the US.

## Background
The rate of deliveries via cesarean section have steadily increased across the US for decades. This is despite the fact that the World Health Organization (WHO) stated in 1985 that the "ideal" rate of cesarean section in a population is somewhere between 10 and 15 percent ([World Health Organization 1985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2863457)). As of this writing, they maintain this position in their [News Center](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/caesarean-sections/en/).

# Audience
The first place that anyone interested in this work should look is the [markdowns](markdowns) folder of this project. This contains all of the documents produced by this project. They are written in the format of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), with snippets of code and data visualizations embedded directly into the narrative. Each of these documents include the complete code-set necessary to be generated, and therefore can be easily validated, and easily updated if the data sets, models, or algorithms used in the project change. If you can read the code, it may help you understand the results, but the narrative should be descriptive enough that non-programmers can understand the reasoning and conclusions.
