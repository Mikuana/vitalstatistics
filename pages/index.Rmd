# Directory

This page acts as a directory for the various studies that have been performed on the _births_ data set included in the `vitalstatistics` package maintained by this author. Every page included in this directory is generated using the data and tools included in this _R_ package, and therefore is entirely open source and reproducible.

You can see the full source code used to generate these documents on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mikuana/vitalstatistics).
